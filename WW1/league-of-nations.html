                        A New Era of Peace: Why America Must Join the League
                    </h3>
                    <p class="byline">By James Mitchell, Washington Correspondent</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        President Wilson's vision of a League of Nations represents humanity's best hope for preventing 
                        another catastrophic war. After witnessing the unprecedented devastation of the Great War, which 
                        claimed millions of lives and destroyed entire nations, America has a moral obligation to lead 
                        the world toward lasting peace.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The League offers a forum where nations can resolve disputes through dialogue rather than warfare. 
                        Through collective security, member nations would stand together against aggression, making war 
                        far less attractive to potential aggressors. America's participation would give the League the 
                        strength and credibility it needs to succeed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Those who advocate for isolation ignore the reality that modern warfare respects no borders. 
                        The next conflict will inevitably draw America in, just as this one did. By joining the League now, 
                        we can help prevent that conflict from ever starting. Our soldiers fought "to make the world safe 
                        for democracy"—abandoning the League would betray their sacrifice.

                        Preserving Our Sovereignty: The Dangers of Foreign Entanglement
                    </h3>
                    <p class="byline">By Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Guest Columnist</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The proposed League of Nations threatens the very foundations of American independence. Article X 
                        of the League Covenant would obligate the United States to defend any member nation against 
                        aggression, effectively surrendering Congress's constitutional power to declare war to an 
                        international body dominated by foreign powers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Our Founding Fathers wisely warned against "entangling alliances" that could drag America into 
                        foreign conflicts that do not serve our national interests. For over a century, this policy has 
                        kept us free and prosperous. The League would reverse this successful strategy, binding us to 
                        intervene in every European squabble and colonial dispute across the globe.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        America has just emerged from a devastating war that cost us dearly in blood and treasure. Our 
                        priority must be rebuilding our own nation, not policing the world. The League is an idealistic 
                        dream that ignores human nature and the realities of international power politics. America must 
                        remain master of its own destiny.

                        <strong>Editorial Stance: AGAINST the League</strong><br>
                        This cartoon depicts Uncle Sam walking away from the League of Nations building, choosing 
                        the path of isolationism instead. The crossroads represents America's critical decision between 
                        international engagement and maintaining traditional isolation from foreign entanglements. By 
                        turning his back on the League, Uncle Sam symbolizes the nation's ultimate rejection of Wilson's 
                        vision and its return to the protective policy of staying out of European affairs.
