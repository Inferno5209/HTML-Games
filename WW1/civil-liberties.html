                    <h3>Explanation</h3>
                    <p>
                        This political cartoon critiques the severe restrictions on free speech and civil liberties 
                        imposed by the U.S. government during World War I. The Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition 
                        Act of 1918 made it illegal to criticize the government, the military, or the war effort, 
                        leading to the arrest and imprisonment of thousands of Americans who dared to speak out. 
                        These laws represented a dangerous erosion of First Amendment rights, demonstrating how fear 
                        and wartime hysteria can justify government overreach that silences dissent and punishes 
                        peaceful opposition.
