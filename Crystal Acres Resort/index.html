                <p id="home-opening-p1">Welcome to Crystal Acres Resort, a family-owned gem nestled in the heart of
                    Gilmanton Iron Works, New
                    Hampshire. Our cottages offer a nostalgic escape, reminiscent of the family cabin you visited as a
                    child. With three charming, and unique cottages for rent, each one is a peaceful retreat where you
                    can unwind and create lasting memories.</p>

                <p id="home-opening-p2">It is just a short walk from the cottages down the hill to the lake and beach.
                    The ample lakefront is
                    shared with the renters in our other two cottages. Our property boasts 200 feet of pristine sandy
                    beach, with a delightful mix of sun and shade, perfect for lounging or enjoying a swim in the
                    crystal-clear lake. The view of the Belknap Mountain Range adds a breathtaking backdrop for your
                    getaway. Whether you're looking for adventure or relaxation, we offer an abundance of activities to
                    suit all ages. The lake temperature typically hovers in the 70s and 80s, making it ideal for
                    swimming and water fun. Take advantage of our three piers, raft, and a selection of boats, including
                    canoes, kayaks, rowboats, and a paddleboat—all available for your enjoyment. If you own any boats
                    you would like to bring up, including motor boats, you are welcome to bring them along. There is a
                    town boat launch conveniently just down the road and our piers are equipped for docking boats. After
                    the sun goes down, enjoy stargazing and listening to the loons call while enjoying a fire on the
                    beach in one of our two portable firepits.</p>

                <p id="home-opening-p3">The property is located on the southern shore of Crystal lake facing north,
                    which offers the rare
                    treat of watching both the sunrise and sunset over the sparkling waters of Crystal Lake. Each
                    cottage is thoughtfully spaced apart, providing privacy and its own dedicated parking, while a
                    shared wood shed ensures guests have easy access to firewood for cozy evenings by the fireplace. The
                    property also features a shuffleboard court and plenty of open space for yard games, making it easy
                    to gather for friendly competition or play. With no roads to cross between the cottages and the
                    shoreline, Crystal Acres Resort is especially safe for children, allowing families to enjoy the lake
                    and grounds with peace of mind.</p>

                <p id="home-opening-p4">We have the perfect setting for family reunions. Our three cottages allow for
                    personal space, while
                    the grounds and lake inspire group activities and family bonding. If you need a little more room, we
                    have a Bunk House that sleeps four. It is a favorite among teens and older kids. With the owners
                    living on the property, there's always someone available to assist you during your stay. You'll
                    enjoy the comfort of knowing we're here to ensure you have everything you need.</p>

                <p id="home-opening-p5">We welcome pets at our property so you can enjoy your stay with your furry
                    companions, but an
                    additional fee applies. For the comfort and safety of all guests, dogs must be kept on leashes while
                    on the grounds and owners are expected to clean up after their pets. Please note that any damage
                    caused by pets is the financial responsibility of the owner, and we kindly ask that pets be
                    well-behaved and respectful of the cottages and surrounding property.</p>

                <p id="home-opening-p6">Crystal Lake is a 455-acre lake known for it's clean water quality. The lake
                    offers scenic views of
                    Belknap Mountain and Mount Major. It is a year-round recreation hub, with summer activities like
                    boating, kayaking, sailing, swimming, and community events such as boat parades and fireworks, while
                    winter brings ice fishing. Anglers enjoy catching rainbow trout, bass, pickerel, and perch, and the
                    lake is also an important breeding ground for loons, bald eagles, herons, and other wildlife, with
                    occasional visits from moose, otters, and beavers.</p>

                <h3 id="info-location-title">Location</h3>
                <p id="info-location-text">Gilmanton Iron Works is conveniently located in New Hampshire's Lakes Region,
                    offering easy access to
                    both the mountains and the seacoast. The village is about 2 hours from Boston, 1 hour 20 minutes
                    from North Conway, 30 minutes from Concord, and a little over 1 hour from Portsmouth. Closer by, the
                    town of Alton is only about 15 minutes away, while Laconia is around 25 minutes. In Alton, visitors
                    will find a Hannaford supermarket along with several dining options, including Shibley's at the Pier
                    overlooking Lake Winnipesaukee, the cozy J.P. China offering Asian cuisine, and Dockside Café for
                    casual lakeside meals. In Laconia, there are larger shopping options, including a Walmart

                <h3 id="info-fishing-title">Fishing</h3>
                <p id="info-fishing-text">In New Hampshire, anyone 16 years or older is required to have a valid fishing
                    license to fish in the
                    state's lakes, rivers, and streams, including Crystal Lake. Licenses help support fisheries
                    management, conservation programs, and access to public waters. The process is simple: you can
                    purchase a license online through the New Hampshire Fish & Game Department website, or in person at
                    many town halls, sporting goods stores, or Fish & Game offices. Options include short-term, annual,
                    and combination hunting/fishing licenses, with discounted rates available for New Hampshire
                    residents. Always be sure to carry your license while fishing, as conservation officers may ask to
                    see it.</p>

                <h3 id="info-boating-title">Boating</h3>
                <p id="info-boating-text">If you plan on bringing a motor boat, please be aware of the laws. The Marine
                    Patrol does come on the
                    lake periodically. In New Hampshire, anyone (must be 16 years or older) operating a motorized boat
                    with more than 25 horsepower (including jet skis) must have a Safe Boating Certificate. Both
                    residents and visitors are required to meet this rule unless they hold a NASBLA-approved boating
                    certificate from another state or a valid U.S. Coast Guard license. To get certified, boaters must
                    complete a state-approved safety course—either online or in person—pass an exam, and then carry the
                    certificate while operating a vessel. This ensures safe and responsible boating on New Hampshire's
                    waterways. More information on requirements and approved courses can be found on the New Hampshire
                    Marine Patrol website.</p>

                <p id="history-bunk-text">Built in 1936, The Bunkhouse is a remarkable piece of Crystal Acres Resort
                    history that has been
                    preserved with its original camp cabin charm. Step inside and you'll discover wood-paneled walls
                    that still bear historic signatures from campers who stayed here in the 1930s, offering a tangible
                    connection to nearly a century of lakeside summers. This authentic structure provides a glimpse into
                    what summer camp life was like in the early 20th century, when families first began making Crystal
                    Acres Resort their vacation destination.</p>

                <p>The Bunkhouse has always been a favorite among children and teenagers, providing generations of young
                    visitors with a sense of independence and adventure. Unlike the main cottages, it maintains its
                    original 1936 simplicity—no modern amenities, just the pure camp experience that has delighted kids
                    for decades. Today, it continues this tradition as an add-on accommodation, perfect for larger
                    family gatherings who want to share in this authentic piece of history.</p>

                <h3 id="history-legacy-title">A Legacy of Family Memories</h3>
                <p id="history-legacy-text">For over 125 years, Crystal Acres Resort has been a place where families
                    reconnect with nature, with
                    each other, and with simpler times. From the early days when our family first fell in love with
                    Crystal Lake, through the 1940s when we began welcoming guests, to today's families who return year
                    after year, the property has remained a constant—a peaceful retreat where the beauty of New
                    Hampshire's lakes and mountains provides the perfect backdrop for creating lasting memories. We are
                    honored to continue this legacy and share our family's treasure with yours.</p>
